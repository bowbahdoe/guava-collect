# guava-collect

## Usage

For the most part, you should be able to just find+replace all
references to `com.google.common` with `dev.mccue.guava`.

Consult the [original documentation](https://github.com/google/guava) for
in-depth usage guides.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.mccue</groupId>
    <artifactId>guava-collect</artifactId>
    <version>33.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## What

This module is a soft-fork of [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) which

* Is shaded under `dev.mccue.guava`
* Has a proper `module-info.java`
* Has all usages of `sun.misc.*`, The Security Manager, and `finalize()` removed.

This module in particular only contains the code from `com.google.common.collect`.

The work of shading is done by [this project](https://github.com/bowbahdoe/guava-generator). Releases of this and dependent modules should contain the guava release or commit hash from which they are generated.

## Why

* It [doesn't seem like guava will be modularized any time soon](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2970#issuecomment-1572148291)
* I want to enable more libraries to be fully modular so that the `jlink`
workflow is more viable
* This was fun to do, and it seems as if some people are interested in the results.

## Support

I'll try to keep up to date, but if you 

* Notice something wrong
* Want me to make a release for a new version
* Want a minute of my time

Feel free to reach out.
